Instead of using bits like classical computers, which can only be in a state of 0 or 1, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously due to a phenomenon called superposition. This allows quantum computers to process vast amounts of data and solve complex problems much faster than classical computers. While still in the early stages of development, quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize fields such as cryptography, drug discovery, and artificial intelligence.\n"
